# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines the creation of a personal blog post about getting invited to Kiro after a three-week waitlist period. The post will be an MDX file following the established blog structure, expressing genuine excitement about Kiro's spec-driven development capabilities while providing valuable insights for readers interested in AI development tools.

## Architecture

### Content Structure
The blog post will follow the established MDX format with:
- **Frontmatter metadata**: Title, description, date, tags, authors, and abstract
- **Main content**: Personal narrative structured in logical sections
- **Engaging tone**: First-person experience sharing with technical insights

### File Organization
- **Location**: `apps/web/blogs/kiro-waitlist-experience.mdx`
- **Naming convention**: Follows kebab-case pattern consistent with existing posts
- **Integration**: Automatically discoverable by the blog system through file-based routing

## Components and Interfaces

### Frontmatter Schema
```typescript
{
  title: string;           // SEO-optimized title capturing excitement
  description: string;     // Meta description for search engines
  date: string;           // ISO 8601 format publication date
  tags: BlogTag[];        // Array of relevant tags from BLOG_TAGS
  authors: string[];      // Author attribution
  abstract: string;       // Brief summary for blog index
}
```

### Tag Selection
Based on content analysis, appropriate tags include:
- `AI_DEVELOPMENT`: Primary focus on AI development tools

## Data Models

### Blog Post Metadata
```typescript
export const metadata = {

  authors: ['Mauricio Acosta'],
  abstract: 'A personal account of getting access to Kiro after weeks of waiting, exploring its spec-driven development approach and agent steering capabilities.',
}
```

### Content Flow
The narrative will follow a chronological and logical progression:
1. **Personal excitement** (emotional hook)

4. **Technical exploration** (spec-driven development)
5. **Practical insights** (agent steering files)
6. **Forward-looking** (future potential)

## Error Handling

### Content Validation
- Ensure proper MDX syntax and frontmatter structure
- Validate tag references against `BLOG_TAGS` constants
