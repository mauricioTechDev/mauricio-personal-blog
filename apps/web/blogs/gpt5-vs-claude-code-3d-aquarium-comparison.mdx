}

Today's a big day ‚Äî **August 8, 2025** ‚Äî the day GPT-5 officially dropped.  

Naturally, I had to test it. But instead of a quick coding prompt, I decided to run it through the same **one-shot challenge** I gave Claude Code (Sonnet 4): build a detailed 3D aquarium app.

Here's the twist: both GPT-5 (through Cursor) and Sonner 4 (through Claude Code). But after running the test, I walked away still preferring Claude.

## The Test

I handed each AI the exact same prompt ‚Äî no back-and-forth, no retries. Just one go at designing and implementing:

- A glass-walled aquarium with sand, lights, and water effects  
- Five different fish species, each with unique behaviors  
- Seaweed, bubbles, and subtle water currents  
- Interactive camera controls  
- A performance-friendly, production-ready setup

```
3D Aquarium Implementation Plan
1. Dependencies Setup
   - Install Three.js (three) and its TypeScript types (@types/three)
   - Install React Three Fiber (@react-three/fiber) for React integration
   - Install React Three Drei (@react-three/drei) for additional 3D components and controls

2. Core 3D Scene Structure
   - Create components/Aquarium3D.tsx as the main aquarium component
   - Set up Canvas with camera, lighting, and controls
   - Implement OrbitControls for drag-to-rotate, zoom, and pan interactions

3. Aquarium Environment
   - Tank: Create transparent glass walls using BoxGeometry with glass material
   - Floor: Add sandy textured floor with noise-based undulations
   - Lighting: Set up ambient and directional lights with blue underwater ambiance
   - Water Effects: Implement fog and particle system for bubbles

4. Aquatic Animals (5 Species)
   Clownfish
      - Orange body with white stripes and black fins
      - Orbital swimming pattern at mid-depth
   Blue Tang
      - Bright blue body with yellow tail and black markings
      - Figure-8 swimming pattern
   Green Sea Turtle
      - Realistic shell geometry and flipper animations
      - Slow, graceful swimming near bottom
   Moon Jellyfish
      - Translucent dome with flowing tentacles
      - Vertical floating motion with tentacle sway
   Reef Manta Ray
      - Large wingspan with realistic wing-flapping animation
      - Gliding motion near surface

5. Interactive Controls
   - Drag to rotate: OrbitControls for camera orbiting
   - Scroll to zoom: Mouse wheel zoom functionality
   - Shift+Drag to pan: Pan controls for view movement

6. Environmental Details
   - Seaweed: Create swaying plant models using custom geometry
   - Bubbles: Particle system with upward movement and random drift
   - Water Current: Subtle animation system affecting all elements

7. Animation System
   - Implement useFrame hook for continuous animations
   - Create reusable swimming patterns and behaviors
   - Add realistic physics-based movements

8. Page Integration
   - Update main page to display 3D Aquarium instead of/alongside Space Invaders
   - Ensure responsive design and proper canvas sizing
   - Add loading states and error boundaries

9. Performance Optimization
   - Implement proper disposal of geometries and materials
   - Use efficient rendering techniques
   - Add fps monitoring capabilities

## The Results

**GPT-5 (Cursor)**  
Cursor's planning interface was impressive ‚Äî it broke down my request methodically and asked for approval before starting. But when it came to execution, the result felt more like a *proof of concept*. Fish animation was minimal, environmental effects were sparse, and while it worked, it didn't capture the aquarium vision from my prompt.

Here's what GPT-5 produced:

*GPT-5/Cursor implementation - functional but basic*

**Claude Code (Sonnet 4)**  
Claude's approach was less ceremonious but hit more of the actual requirements. While the fish were still pretty basic, it made more genuine attempts to include the species I requested, added more environmental details, and felt like it was actually trying to match the spirit of my prompt.

And here's Claude Code's version:

  <source src="/videos/claude-code-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

*Claude Code implementation - closer to the prompt requirements (though still imperfect)*

Neither result was production-ready, but Claude Code's version made a more honest attempt at fulfilling the specific requirements, even if the execution was still quite simple.

## Why It Matters

This wasn't just about building an aquarium. It was about testing whether I'd stick with Claude now that GPT-5 was out.

Here's what I learned:

* **Same model ‚â† same results** ‚Äî interface, tuning, and workflow matter a lot
* GPT-5 (Cursor) shined in structured planning but felt weaker in direct execution  
* Claude Code seemed better tuned for coding tasks that need more *follow-through*
* For complex technical requirements, Claude made more genuine attempts to implement what was actually requested

## Final Take

On launch day, I really wanted GPT-5 to surprise me. And while it's impressive, for coding something creative and detail-heavy like this aquarium, **Claude Code still feels like the one I'd trust first**.

That could change as tools evolve ‚Äî but for today, Claude keeps the crown. üê†
